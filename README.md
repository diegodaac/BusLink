BusLink
Overview

BusLink is a web-based application designed to manage and sell bus tickets through a centralized system. The platform is developed using Flask for the backend and MySQL as the database, with a responsive frontend built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

The application implements role-based access to support different operational needs within a bus transportation system, focusing on ticket sales, user management, and trip information.

Features

BusLink provides access to the system through multiple user roles:

Ticket Office (Taquilla):
Allows staff to sell bus tickets and manage customer transactions efficiently.

Administration Panel:
Enables administrators to manage user accounts, including activating and deactivating users within the system.

Driver View:
Provides drivers with access to trip-related information, such as active routes and upcoming journeys.

Each view is designed to display only the information relevant to the corresponding role.
