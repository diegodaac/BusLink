BusLink

BusLink is a web-based application designed for managing and selling bus tickets through a centralized system. The platform is built using Flask as the backend framework and MySQL as the database, with a responsive frontend developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

The application provides role-based access to different system views, allowing efficient management of operations and users:

Ticket Office (Taquilla): Interface for selling bus tickets and managing customer transactions.

Administration Panel: Allows administrators to manage user accounts, including activation and deactivation of users.

Driver View: Provides drivers with access to trip information, including active and upcoming routes.

BusLink focuses on organizing core ticketing workflows, user management, and trip visibility in a simple and structured web application, serving as an academic project that demonstrates backend development, database integration, and role-based access control.
